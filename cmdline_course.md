The course is intended to be a gentle introduction to command-line tools for linguists. It is organised as an online course, with weekly assignments and a final project. The course covers the fundamentals of Unix-like command-line environments that are relevant to linguists.

According to the [course page](https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/kik-lg218/126710126), after completing the course, students are able to:

- operate in a Unix-like environment.
- use Unix command-line on a Windows or Mac OSX computer.
- use the Unix command-line.
- use regular expressions.
- processing corpora at a basic level.
- run programs from the command-line.
- install programs.
- write basic scripts.
- use version control tools.
- work on a remote server.
- create and host a webpage on GitHub Pages.
- stay calm and google when things go wrong.

I feel like the last point is especially important.
